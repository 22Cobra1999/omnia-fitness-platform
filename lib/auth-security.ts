/**
 * User Data Storage and Security
 *
 * This file documents how user data is stored and secured in the OMNIA application.
 *
 * 1. Data Storage:
 *    - User credentials and profile information are stored in the PostgreSQL database
 *    - Passwords are hashed using a secure one-way hashing algorithm with salt
 *    - Authentication tokens are stored as HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
 *
 * 2. Security Measures:
 *    - Passwords are never stored in plain text
 *    - Authentication tokens have expiration times
 *    - HTTP-only cookies prevent JavaScript access to auth tokens
 *    - CSRF protection is implemented for all state-changing operations
 *    - Input validation is performed on all user inputs
 *    - Database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
 *
 * 3. Database Tables:
 *    - users: Stores core user information (name, email, hashed password)
 *    - user_sessions: Tracks active user sessions
 *    - user_security_logs: Logs security events (login attempts, password changes)
 *    - user_connected_accounts: Stores OAuth connections to third-party services
 *
 * 4. Recommended Practices:
 *    - Regular security audits
 *    - Automatic session timeout after period of inactivity
 *    - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
 *    - Two-factor authentication for sensitive operations
